- Many people believe that the average body temperature of a healthy adult is 37o Celsius. 
- We want to know if there is evidence that the average body temperature of a healthy adult is diferent from 37o Celsius.
- Our null hypothesis is that the population mean is 37o Celsius: H0 : µ = 37oC.
- Our alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is not 37o Celsius: H0 : µ = 37oC.
