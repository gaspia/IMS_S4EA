## S4DS Lecture 01 from 20th Feb 2021

### Sampling example in R

Creating a population of Students and agents into a data frame.

```{r echo=FALSE}
Names = c("Bob", "Mary", "William", "George", "Lucas", "Mathew", "Angel", "Steven", "Ariana", "Chen")
# printing the size of the array
length (Names)
```
---
A New array with the ages

```{r}
Ages = c(22, 23, 21, 25, 28, 25, 23, 23, 32, 28)
length(Ages)
```
---
Now for the data frame creation
```{r}
Pop = data.frame(Names = Names, Ages = Ages)

head(Pop)
```
---

Sampling 4 students out of the data frame without replacement
---
```{r}
S = sample(1:10,size = 4, replace = FALSE )

# checking the results
head(S)

```
---
Creating a final data frame with all the sampled candidates data (Ages)

```{r}
S.data = Pop[S,]
S.data
```
