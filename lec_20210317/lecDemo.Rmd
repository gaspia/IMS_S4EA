This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
bt=read.csv("./data/Bodytemp.csv", header=T)
head(bt)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
dim(bt)
```

```{r}
mean(bt$BodyTemp)
```

```{r}
sd(bt$BodyTemp)
```

```{r}
MASS::truehist(bt$BodyTemp, 
  main="Body temperature;
  xlab=substitute(paste("Mean=", mean, "; Stdev=", 
    list(mean=signif(mean(bt$BodyTemp),
    std=signif(sd(bt$BodyTemp,

```

```{}
